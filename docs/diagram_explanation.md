Below is a concise explanation of all points and segments used in this Earth Curvature Calculator model, including the new variables **XC = h₂** and **L₀**.

## 1. Center of the Earth (O)
- Serves as the origin of our geometry.
- OB and OX are radii of the Earth, equal to R.

## 2. Observer's Eye-Level Position Above Sea Level (A)
- The observer is at height h₁ above Earth's surface.
- Therefore, OA = R + h₁, where R is the Earth's radius.

## 3. Horizon Point (B)
- The point on Earth's surface where the line from A is tangent to Earth.
- In triangle AOB, the angle at B is 90°.
- Segment AB defines the line of sight to the horizon.

## 4. Base of the Object/Structure (X)
- The object/structure's base on the Earth's surface, so OX = R.
- This point is located "beyond the horizon" from A's perspective.

## 5. Total Distance on Sea Level (L₀)
- **L₀** is defined as the total distance from the observer's sea-level position to X.
- You may interpret L₀ as the **surface distance** or **straight-line distance** at sea level, depending on how your model is set up.

## 6. Intersection of the Line of Sight with the Object (C)
- Extend the line from A (through B) until it meets the object's vertical extension at C.
- **XC = h₂** is the portion of the object hidden below the horizon due to Earth's curvature.

## 7. Top of the Object (Z)
- The highest point of the object above X.
- XZ is the full, true vertical height of the object.

## 8. Hidden Portion (XC = h₂)
- This segment, X → C, is the distance along the object that is blocked by Earth's curvature.
- In other words, **XC = h₂**.

## 9. Actual Visible Portion (CZ)
- The remainder of the object from C to Z.
- **CZ** is the **actual (physical) vertical height** of the object above the horizon line.

## 10. Apparent (Perspective-Adjusted) Visible Portion (CD)
- Because the Earth's curvature makes the top of the object "lean away" from the observer, the line CZ is not perpendicular to the horizon line BC.
- Define a point D such that CD is perpendicular (90°) to the **horizon line** BC.
- **CD** is thus the **perspective-adjusted** or **apparent** height that the observer sees above the horizon.

## Summary

1. **O**: Earth's center (with radius R).
2. **A**: Observer at R + h₁.
3. **B**: Horizon point, tangent from A.
4. **X**: Base of the distant object at radius R.
5. **L₀**: Distance at sea level from the observer's base position to X.
6. **C**: Where the line of sight meets the object.
   - XC = h₂ = **hidden portion**.
7. **Z**: Top of the object.
   - CZ = **actual** height visible above the horizon.
8. **D**: A point for measuring the apparent height (CD) perpendicular to the line BC.
   - CD = **apparent (perspective-adjusted)** height.

In this model, **XC = h₂** is the amount of the object blocked by Earth's curvature, while **CZ** and **CD** give two different measures of how much of the object is above the horizon:
- **CZ** = physically visible vertical distance.
- **CD** = how tall it appears when projected onto the horizon line.
